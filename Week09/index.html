                    <p>I enjoyed this weeks readings. When dealing with API's and JSON in the past I was always just handed something and told what to do with it.<br><br>
                        <br><br>
                    I have bookmarked these readings so that I can refer back to them when needed, since I will most likely have to reread some things a few times more to understand it fully.

                    My team gathering went well. David the main driver of this weeks gathering and helped guide the activity. Here is the <a href="https://adamfinder.github.io/WDD330/Week09/index-START.html">link</a>
                    for our group assignment. I will also include this on my portfolio home page.
