                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <p>
                    This week didn't really go over anything major other than just refreshing information taught from previous classes. I did enjoy the refresher on some of the Javascript items.
                    Javascript is not something that I am incredibly familiar with, actually my knowledge of it is pretty non-existent. Previous classes would hint at it and give us some to copy
                    and paste into our work, but never really taught much outside of what we were taking did. I have studied it a little in the past but without really knowing where to start it
                    is daunting to get into at first glance.
                    <br><br>
                    "If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. That leads to simple beautiful apps. If you
                    do it the other way around, it'll be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither simple, nor beautiful." This quote right here really struck a chord
                    with me. I need to remember to take things in smaller chunks instead of focusing solely on the end result. Too often I get caught up on the end look of how it is on desktop 
                    that I never consider the mobile interface and how it looks. Some projects I have done in the past have been great on a desktop/laptop but failed horrifically on mobile. I 
                    need to remember to slow down, take my time, and work things step by step.

                    At this time I don't have any questions regarding the material that was given this week.
                    <br>
                    Here is a <a href="https://adamfinder.github.io/WDD330/Week01/story_editor.html">link</a> to the Story Editor exercise that was given in the reading that I conpleted along 
                    with the reading.
