                <h3>Notes</h3>
                    <p>This week was a fun refresher on topics that I am familiar with. By no means am I a pro but I was able to concoct a form with requirements in it. If you try to submit before filling out each field you will be asked to fill out the field(s) that is missing.</p>
                    <div>
                        <form>
                            <fieldset>
                                <legend>User Information</legend>
                                <label>First Name<input type="text" name="fname" required></label>
                                <label>Last Name<input type="text" name="lname" required></label>
                                <label>Email Address<input type="text" name="email"></label>
                                <label>Phone Number<input type="text" name="phone" required></label>
                                <label>Zip Code<input type="number" name="zip" required></label>
                            </fieldset>
                            <input class="submit" type="submit" value="Submit">
                        </form>   
                    </div>
                    <p>
                    It was a lot of fun to create this and I now have some ideas for how I can implement something like this. I also figured out you can give the form tag a "action" which can lead to another webpage upon submission. The fetch portion I don't really know how to code that for an example but it was a good refresher to have. I ended up going back to my SWAPI activity and refrecing that plus the readings to help with this weeks quakes activity.

                    My team gathering went well. I was the main driver of this weeks gathering and helped guide the activity. This week was rough, but we were able to get it plus some stretch goals. We ended up refrencing past activities and readings to help accomplish this weeks activity. Here is the <a href="https://adamfinder.github.io/WDD330/Week10/quakes.html">link</a>
                    for our group assignment. I will also include this on my portfolio home page.
