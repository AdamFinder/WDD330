                    <p>It seemed this week was more heavily focused on CSS styling, which I way more familiar with than JS. SVG though has been a rough subject for me to fully comprehend. I have only ever used it once amybe twice. The sections on drawing basic shapes helped with getting a basic understanding started. I did not know about the SVG free draw applications though such as https://inkscape.org/ which will come in handy. <br><br>

                    I have bookmarked these readings so that I can refer back to them when needed.

                    My team gathering went well. I was the main driver of this weeks gathering and helped guide the activity. Here is the <a href="https://adamfinder.github.io/WDD330/Week08/team08.html">link</a>
                    for our group assignment. I will also include this on my portfolio home page.
