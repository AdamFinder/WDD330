                <h3>Notes</h3>
                    This week was interesting. Figuring out the battle rythm for a class throws me off at first but is manageable. It just takes the effort from me to balance my work and school.
                    I will say that it is a good thing I did the readings early this week for the refresher I so desperately needed, and still need.
                    <br><br>
                    Going over the first couple chapters were a nice review that I was able to recall on and firmly grasp with a good understanding. Arrays, Logic, and Loops served as a great
                    refresher on how to appropriately create these and utilize them. Functions however, were a different story. Java has always been a thorn in my side since I started my classes in
                    2019. No matter what I do I still struggle with it and find myself lost when trying to find a solution. The chapter on functions though really helped get my foot in the door, 
                    it kept things simple and bitsized for a more manageable understanding. I know loops and arrays and a miriad of other things fit into JS, but when putting it all together I get lost.
                    The simple approach the book took when talking about functions and other JS uses was appealing and not jarring to see. Going forward I will continue into looking for more ways to help my
                    understanding of JS so I can effectively use it.

                    My team gathering went well. David Bentley was the main driver of this weeks gathering and worked wonders with helping my understanding of JS even further. Here is the <a href="https://adamfinder.github.io/WDD330/Week02/team02.html">link</a>
                    for our group assignment. I will also include this on my portfolio home page.
