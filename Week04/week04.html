                <h3>Notes</h3>
                    <p>This week was fun. The effort I am making to understanding Javascript is coming along. I am still far away from being comfortable with it but I can feel and see my understanding growing. David in my team has also been a very significant help in understanding the logic behind what we are working on.

                    The readings this week were helpful and made more sense due to my previous efforts. it's really cool to see Java used in so many different ways, and not just one way can be the solution you are looking for, there are multiple ways to achieve what you want from it. Building the Tic Tac Toe was fun, albeit infuriating at times but fun.

                    My team gathering went well. David was the main driver of this weeks gathering and helped guide the activity. Here is the <a href="https://adamfinder.github.io/WDD330/Week04/team04.html">link</a>
                    for our group assignment. I will also include this on my portfolio home page.
