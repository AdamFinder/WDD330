                <h3>Notes</h3>
                    <p>Calling methods and properties were the topics that caught my interest this week. I am still having a rough time with it, but this example did start to help my understanding of how to find properties for an object. <br><br>
                        for(const key in superman) {<br>
                        console.log(key + ": " + superman[key]);<br>
                    }<br>
                    << "name: Superman"<br>
                    << "real name: Clark Kent"<br>
                    << "height: 75"<br>
                    << "weight: 235"<br>
                    << "hero: true"<br>
                    << "villain: false"<br>
                    << "allies: Batman,Supergirl,Superboy"<br>
                    << "fly: function (){<br>
                        console.log(\"Up, up and away!\");<br>
                    }"<br>
                        <br><br>
                    I made sure to bookmark these readings so that I can come back and refresh/quiz myself on these items, since this is still a relatively new thing to me.

                    My team gathering went well. David was the main driver of this weeks gathering and helped guide the activity. Here is the <a href="https://adamfinder.github.io/WDD330/Week07/week07.html">link</a>
                    for our group assignment. I will also include this on my portfolio home page.
