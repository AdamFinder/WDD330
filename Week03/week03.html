                <h3>Notes</h3>
                    <p>Finally after a 12 hour caffeine induced study session I am making progress to understanding Javascript! This week was rough since I was not familiar at all with the different javascript functions, but it was nice to learn about them.
                        <br><br>
                    The videos and readings this week were a real pleasure to get through. It was cool to see how different aspects of Javascript that may be a little long and convoluted could be simplified by certain array functions that are available. For instance how the "Array.prototype.reduce()" can be used to simplify a for loop and the miriad of steps it takes to create one. It was difficult to understand at first and caused me and my team a little trouble near the end of our session. As time goes on my comfortability with the Java language is increasing.

                    My team gathering went well. I was the main driver of this weeks gathering and helped guide the activity. Here is the <a href="https://adamfinder.github.io/WDD330/Week03/team03.html">link</a>
                    for our group assignment. I will also include this on my portfolio home page.
